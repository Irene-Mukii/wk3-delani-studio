## Behavior Driven Development
This is how I broke down the problem statement to come up with this Amzing Application:

* I started by putting in all the text input required on the HTML
* I then added in the images required.
* I decided to start with what is familiar, so I began by toggling the 'WHAT WE DO' segment.
* I went ahead to create the input Forms
* I left the mail chip and jQuery as the last thing to do.
